# popupsv17

4D v19 brought feature to build dropdown list using collections. This library provides similar functionality for v17 databases.

I am using a lot of dropdown lists in conjunction with listboxes to display selection of records based on the values chosen in dropdown lists. This library makes it easier to do so and to call method that will perform query.

## Methods

popupsInit - initializes one popup (dropdown) list in form

Call this method in form method for each dropdown list you want to handle in the form

popupsOnDataChangev17 - handles On Data Change event
